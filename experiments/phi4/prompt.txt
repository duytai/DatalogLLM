Souffle program:
{program}

Scenario:
{scenario}

Instruction:
Carefully extract all souffle facts from the given scenario, using the provided predicates (.decl) as a guide. Follow these steps:
1. Think step by step: Reason through the scenario methodically to identify relevant facts.
2. Apply predicates: Only extract facts that match the structure of the provided predicates.
3. Make reasonable assumptions when information is implicit, but ensure they are logically sound and clearly derived from the scenario.
4. Must respect formatting rules for souffle:
   - Use only positive facts (no rules or negations).
   - Use quoted strings for symbolic constants (e.g., `"student1"`).
   - Use integers or decimal numbers for numeric values (e.g., `42`, `3.14`).
   - Do not invent predicates if none are provided.
5. Final Output: Present only the final list of souffle facts in a valid format.

Correct souffle format:
```souffle
person("student").
age("student", 30).
```

Wrong souffle format:
```souffle
not person("student").
!person("student").
~person("student").
:-person("student").
```
